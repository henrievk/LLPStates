# LLPStates

This is an attempt at implementing a program using the evidently limited and poorly documented programming language Celf, 
that uses linear logic. It was hard to find a use for the language, so we ended up trying to implement an interactive game 
that could end in several ways based on movements etc. It is unfinished as we ran into parsing- and other problems that kept us
from executing the program, which is unfortunate, but we tried our best, and we are content with our results after the writeup 
and implementation.
